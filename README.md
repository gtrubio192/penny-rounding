# penny-rounding
Split a total by a value, round each divided value to 2 decimal places

1. Create a function called “moneySplitter” that takes a decimal value called “total” as input.

2. Create a function to call from “moneySplitter” that splits “total” evenly into three decimal

variables, and rounds each result to the nearest two decimals. Return these three

decimal variables as a list or array.

3. Create another function to call from “moneySplitter” that validates that all list/array items

created by the previous function add up to the total value. If they do not add up, the

function should add/subtract a penny (.01) from each list/array item until the values

match the parent target value. Return the validated decimal variables as a list or array.

4. Print the result of both function calls in “moneySplitter.”

5. Write code to call moneySplitter with 800.0 as the argument.

6. BONUS: Add an extra parameter to moneySplitter called “count” that enables “total” to

be divided among “count” people.
